Home Office Office 365 accounts # Developers require a Home Office O365 account to access most of the developer services and tools. This can be requested by emailing xxx . The request must come from COP's approved requestors. 2. GitHub # The developer can add their GitHub account to the UKHomeOffice GitHub organisation via the Hub's 'Services Onboarding': https://hub.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/onboarding/services Once done, the COP Admins will need to add the developers account to the COP Developers team, which will provide permissions to the COP projects.s NOTE: You need to sign all your commits with GPG when pushing your code, please refer to Managing commit signature verification and get your account setup before pushing. 3. ACP GitLab # Using their O365 account, the developer needs to log into ACP GitLab: https://gitlab.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk Once done, a COP Admin can add the developer to the COP group: https://gitlab.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/groups/cop/-/group_members NOTE: You need to sign all your commits with GPG when pushing your code, please refer to Signing commits with GPG and get your account setup before pushing. 4. COP JIRA and JIRA Service Desk # Using their O365 account, the developer needs to log into COP JIRA: Once the developer has logged in, they will initially only have access to the Customer Portal. A COP Admin needs to assign the COP JIRA user role in our Production Keycloak realm. The developer then needs to log out and in again to inherit the correct permissions via SSO. 5. Home Office Slack # Using their O365 account, the developer can create an account at: https://hod-dsp.slack.com/#/ They then need to be added to the relevant private channels, based on their role. 6. ACP VPNs # Using their O365 account, the developer can log into https://remote-access.vpn.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/ For some of the following steps, they must be on the KUBE-PLATFORM VPN. 7. ACP Hub and Kubernetes clusters # The developer needs to connect to the KUBE-PLATFORM VPN and then log into the ACP Hub: https://hub.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/ Once done, a COP Admin can add the developer to the COP project and create suitable tokens: https://hub.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/projects/detail/cop The developer can follow the guides linked to from the Hub to set up their Kubernetes access credentials, along with accessing other shared services: Kibana Drone (GitLab and GitHub) 8. ACP Keycloak # When accessing COP Services, the developer will need to log in via Keycloak. Some services require additional roles to be set in the COP Keycloak realms. 9.
